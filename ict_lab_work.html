    <h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
    <p>Bitcoin is a type of digital money that exists only online and is not controlled by any bank or government. It uses blockchain technology,
    which keeps all transactions secure and transparent. Because only 21 million bitcoins can ever exist, many people see it as valuable and use it
    for investment or fast online payments.</p>

    <h2>How Bitcoin Works</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin works through a system called blockchain, a public digital ledger that records all transactions. When someone sends Bitcoin,
    the transaction is verified by miners, grouped into a block, and added to the blockchain. This process makes transactions secure, permanent, 
    and decentralized, allowing Bitcoin to operate without banks or governments..</p>
